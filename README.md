# Battlecode Deerhunt Game

## What is Battlecode?

Battlecode is a real-time strategy game for which teams will program an AI player to face off against an enemy AI player. The rules of the game vary from year-to-year and teams are able to refine their robots as the tournament goes on. Checkout the [Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/) website for more information. Previous competitions hosted by MIT can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOrfTSnyimIXfYzI8j_-CTQ).
