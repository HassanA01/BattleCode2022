# PyCharm guide

This guide is a quick setup guide to get things running in PyCharm.

### Install PyCharm and Python

If you haven't already, install python from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
The latest python version should be fine. Although python 3.9 is recommended as our servers run that.
Lower versions should also work.

You can also install PyCharm from the [Jetbrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).
The community edition is free to use, but the professional edition is free for students, if you [sign up](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).

After you have installed pycharm, you can get through the setup screen until you reach the new project landing page.
