#### GAME ENGINE CODE
### MOVE
# transform -> (x,y,direction,magnitude), direction can be game specific [abstract]
# repr -> ()
# isValid -> ()

#### GAME SPECIFIC CODE
#A list of valid moves
#Factory for creating moves -> given a moveset, create a move
### GAME-MOVE  
#transform -> import from GAME ENGINE MOVE, transforms based on direction
#repr -> (), return a string version of the move, the subClass should implemenet this
# isValid -> (game state) check to see if this is a valid move, the subClass should implement this
